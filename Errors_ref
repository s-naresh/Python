- ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'c:\\programdata\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\importlib_metadata-0.17.dist-info\\INSTALLER'

- There is a formula for calculating the correct pagefile size. Initial size is 
one and a half (1.5) x the amount of total system memory. Maximum size is three (3) x the initial size. 
So let's say you have 4 GB (1 GB = 1,024 MB x 4 = 4,096 MB) of memory. 
The initial size would be 1.5 x 4,096 = 6,144 MB and the maximum size would be 3 x 6,144 = 18,432 MB.

## error , NLP , spacy 
- package = spacy
- command = nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
- error = OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en_core_web_lg'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
=> you could do python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg and then python -m spacy link en_core_web_lg en. 
That would make en a name for en_core_web_lg, which is a large spaCy model for the English language.

OR 
For those who are still facing problems even after installing it as administrator from Anaconda prompt, here's a quick fix:

1) Got to the path where it is downloaded. For e.g.

C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\en_core_web_sm\en_core_web_sm-2.2.0

2) Copy the path.

3) Paste it in: nlp = spacy.load(r'C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\en_core_web_sm\en_core_web_sm-2.2.0')

4) Works like a charm :)

PS: Check for spacy version
