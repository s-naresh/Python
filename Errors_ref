- There is a formula for calculating the correct pagefile size. Initial size is 
one and a half (1.5) x the amount of total system memory. Maximum size is three (3) x the initial size. 
So let's say you have 4 GB (1 GB = 1,024 MB x 4 = 4,096 MB) of memory. 
The initial size would be 1.5 x 4,096 = 6,144 MB and the maximum size would be 3 x 6,144 = 18,432 MB.
